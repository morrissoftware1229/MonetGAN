# Project Title: MonetGAN (Use GANs to create art)
Creates artwork using a GAN similar to Monet's style

## Description

This project focuses on creating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to emulate Claude Monet's artistic style. It involves the design of a GAN, comprising a generator and a discriminator model. The goal is to generate between 7,000 and 10,000 images that capture the essence of Monet's style, while simultaneously learning about the intricacies of GANs. This project represents our participation in Kaggle's competition, [I’m Something of a Painter Myself](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started).
